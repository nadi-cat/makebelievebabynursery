    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Make Believe was born from a passion for lifelike artistry. Our lead artist Yoshiko Smith has been painting reborn dolls for over 5 years. With a background in fine arts from college, every doll is a result of dedication, detail, and love. We create more than dolls â€” we create keepsakes filled with soul and personality. Our commitment to quality and realism makes our dolls stand out, and our experience has made us a trusted name among collectors and educators alike.</p>
